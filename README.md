# Language Learning App

This is a Next.js app using React for the frontend, Prisma for database management, and SQLite for local storage. It includes authentication with NextAuth (Feide) and ElevenLabs integration. The app allows users to talk to agents and learn languages interactively.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed on your machine.
- npm (comes with Node.js) for package management.

## Installation

All dependencies (including Next.js, Prisma, clsx, next-auth@beta, @elevenlabs/react) can be installed with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Features

- User roles: Student/Teacher (from Prisma schema).
- Database models: User (with email, name, role). Post model is commented out for now.
- View the database easily with Prisma Studio

## Configuration

Before running the app, create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

    FEIDE_CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>

    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/
    ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
    NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ID=<your_agent_id>

Also create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:
DATABASE_URL=<file:./testDB.db>

Set up the database with Prisma:
